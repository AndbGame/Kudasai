# Genders (Selective)
# Set Gender Combinations which are allowed to assault another here. Genders which arent set will be implicitly considered allowed
# Keys listed under "Follower" only apply to Followers and will overwrite common Keys if possible
# Syntax: Victim<-Aggressor
# Keys:
#   * - Wildcard (Aggressor only)
#   M - Male
#   F - Female
#   H - Futa
#   C - Creature
# Examples:
#   M<-M: false   -> A male will never assault another male
#   F<-F: true    -> A female is allowed to assault another female (same as if you didnt set anything)
#   C<-*: false   -> A Creature will never be assaulted by anyone
#   Follower:
#     M<-M: true  -> A male follower will be assaulted by another male (despite M<-M being disabled)
Selective:
  C<-*: false
  Follower:
    M<-M: true

# Creatures
# Creatures are grouped together based on their "RaceType". This Type is used to group similar creatures together, such as Dogs and Wolves
# If you don't want a certain Creature Race to be excluded from Y. Kudasai, set them to 'false' here. Does NOT stop them from defeating you
