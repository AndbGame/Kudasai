# Genders TODO: rewrite
# This list is used to validate different Gender Combinations. If a combination is not listed, the last aggressor  
# will be removed until only 1 aggressor is left. This does NOT affect who will participate in the assault
# If this combination is not found either, the request will be considered invalid (the aggressor(s) will be 
# considered unintrested in the victim)
# To create a new combination, simply add them to the below list
# Syntax: Victim<-Aggressor(s)
# Keys:
#   * - Wildcard, represents any Gender. Only checked if there are no other matching Combinations
#   M - Male
#   F - Female
#   H - Futa
#   C - Creature
#   Z - F. Creature
# Priority: M > F > H > C > Z
# Examples:
#   F<-M: true    => A male is allowed to assault a female
#   F<-M: false   => A male is NOT allowed to assault a female
#   F<-MM: true   => Two males are allowed to assault a female (including when F<-M is not allowed or not present)
#   M<-MH: true   => A male and a Futa are allowed to assault a male
#   M<-HM: true   => Invalid, because males have ahigher priority, they must be listed first. This will never be read
Combinations:
  # Male
  M<-*: true
  M<-C: false
  M<-**: false # overrides M<-*, thus only 1v1 Assaults are allowed for male victims, 1v2+ assaults fall back to this
  # Female
  F<-*: true
  # Futa
  H<-*: true
  H<-H: false
  H<-C: false
  # Creature
  C<-*: false
  # F. Creature
  Z<-*: false

# Creatures
# Creatures are grouped together based on a unique Identifier called "RaceKey". Similar to SexLab, similar Creatures will use
# the same RaceKey. If you don't want a certain Creature Race to be part of Animations, simply disable them here.
