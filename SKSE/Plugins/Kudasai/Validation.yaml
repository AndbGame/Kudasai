# Genders
# This list is used to validate different Gender Combinations. If a combination is not listed, the last aggressor  
# will be removed until only 1 aggressor is left. This does NOT affect who will participate in the assault
# If this combination is not found either, the request will be considered invalid (the aggressor(s) will be 
# considered unintrested in the victim)
# To create a new combination, simply add them to the below list
# Syntax: Victim<-Aggressor(s)
# Keys:
#   * - Wildcard, represents any Gender. Only checked if there are no other matching Combinations
#   M - Male
#   F - Female
#   H - Futa
#   C - Creature
#   Z - F. Creature
# Priority: M > F > H > C > Z
# Examples:
#   F<-M: true    => A male is allowed to assault a female
#   F<-M: false   => A male is NOT allowed to assault a female
#   F<-MM: true   => Two males are allowed to assault a female (including when F<-M is not allowed or not present)
#   M<-MH: true   => A male and a Futa are allowed to assault a male
#   M<-HM: true   => Invalid, because males have ahigher priority, they must be listed first. This will never be read
Combinations:
  # Male
  M<-*: true
  M<-C: false
  M<-**: false # overrides M<-*, thus only 1v1 Assaults are allowed for male victims, 1v2+ assaults fall back to this
  # Female
  F<-*: true
  # Futa
  H<-*: true
  H<-H: false
  H<-C: false
  # Creature
  C<-*: false
  # F. Creature
  Z<-*: false

# Creatures
# Creatures are divided & grouped based on their individual body data, rather than the race itself. This means that similar
# Creatures will be considered equal. To customize this section, you can eiher disable the entire Racegroup or add specific 
# Races to the Exceptions Section
# Exceptions target individual Races, independend of their RaceGroup. An Exception can be including or excluding, they do not need
# to be listed in a RaceGroup. This allows you to exclude individual Races from a Racegroup without disabling the entire Racegroup
# (e.g. Wolves & Foxes share 1 Racegroup, you can use Exception to exclude Foxes specifically) or add custom Races from other mods
# Adding an Exception:
#   Open the mod containing the race you want to exclude in the Creation Kit (or xEdit) and search for the race's EditorID. Add
#   this ID to the exceptions list (Note: Exceptions use partial matching, thus a unique substring will suffice). Then state if
#   the Exception is including or excluding, by adding either ": true" (including) or ": false" (excluding) behind the ID
